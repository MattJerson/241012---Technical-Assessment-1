# Building a Conversational Chatbot Using Transformers

## Objective
Participants will learn how to build a simple chatbot using transformer models like BERT or GPT that can recognize intents and extract entities. The workshop will also cover implementing a basic feedback mechanism to improve responses.

## Agenda

### 1. Introduction
- Overview of chatbots and their applications.
- Introduction to transformer models (BERT, GPT) and their advantages in natural language understanding.
- Key features of the chatbot to be developed:
  - Intent recognition
  - Entity extraction
  - Basic reinforcement learning concept for improving responses.

### 2. Setup
Ensure participants have the necessary tools installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install transformers torch nltk flask
